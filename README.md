# Digital Citizenship Group Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the digital citizenship group project created by [Your Group Name]. The project focuses on educating users about digital citizenship through an articulate storyboard comprising lessons, quizzes, and a game component.

## Content Overview
The project is divided into three main sections:
1. **Lesson**: This section provides educational content on various aspects of digital citizenship.
2. **Quiz**: Users can test their knowledge through interactive quizzes based on the lessons.
3. **Game**: An engaging game component consisting of four different applications aimed at reinforcing the concepts learned in the lessons and quizzes.

## Game Description
The game component comprises four applications, each contributing 25 points towards a total of 100 points required to complete the game. Players have multiple attempts for each game. If they successfully complete a game, the corresponding button will change to green, indicating completion. Conversely, if they fail, the button will display as red, allowing them to retry. The objective is to accumulate 100 points across all four games to finish the game successfully.

1. **Create a Strong Password**: Players are tasked with creating a password that is strong enough to protect their computer. They'll be guided through best practices for creating secure passwords.
   
2. **Agree or Disagree**: Players are presented with text content related to digital citizenship. They must carefully read the content and then check the box if they agree with it. Once satisfied, they can press the submit button to proceed.

3. **Accept Cookies**: Players must select the cookies they are willing to accept. They'll be presented with a list of cookies and asked to choose the ones they find acceptable. After making their selections, they can press the submit button to continue.

4. **Choose Safe Programs**: Players are presented with a list of programs and must select those they believe will not harm their computer. They'll need to demonstrate their understanding of safe software choices to complete this game.

Players are encouraged to engage with each application to reinforce their understanding of digital citizenship principles and earn points towards completion.
